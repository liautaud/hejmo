## Idea

Our goal is simple: using smart home and AI technologies, we want to make the flat-sharing experience as seamless as possible for both the guest and the host, from check-in to check-out.

Imagine this: you rented a flat for a night on Airbnb, but the host can't welcome you in person. No problem: just show up at the doorstep. Our AI will recognize you, notify the host and automatically unlock the door. As you open the door, the entire flat prepares for your arrival. All the electrical outlets turn on, the thermostat changes to your preferences, the media center connects to your Spotify and Netflix accounts automatically, and your devices pair with the WiFi network without you having to do anything. You might be miles away, but this new flat will feel just like home.

Need anything? Perhaps you want to discover interesting places to visit during your stay, play some music, or you're just not sure by which time you must leave the flat. Just ask the flat's voice assistant: it is tailored to your preferences, and will help make your stay as comfortable as possible. And, when it's time to check out, you don't have to worry about anything. Just grab your suitcase and walk out the door. Our AI will lock it behind you, turn off the electricity, lower the thermostat setting, and disconnect all your accounts.

Now, with this level of tailoring, you might be concerned about your privacy. Don't worry: we are too. That's why our solution is private-by-design: all your preferences and credentials are encrypted and stored on device, so they are never sent to the cloud, and nobody but you will be able to access them.

Moreover, we would also expand house sharing to experience sharing. The host will be able to define his favorite places and what he enjoys doing. Each guest can access these suggestions and add their own to refine the experience linked to this place. Hence, the identity of the place will strenghten over time, and the guests will not only share an house with the host, but an experience fit to them.
